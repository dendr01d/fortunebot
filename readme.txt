Because I'm a dumb idiot and I need to write down how this all fits together
And also to explain to anybody actually interested enough to look into this project

main.py is the driver of the program
It authorizes itself with twitter, builds the model from the corpus, then runs the main loop

The corpus is just a list of fortunes I compiled. It may be inefficient to build the model from scratch every time the bot is run, but it's not like it's expensive enough of a process to matter

The main loop does this in order:
-check if enough time has passed to tweet. If it has:
	-spit out a new tweet generated by the model
	-figure out how long to wait until tweeting again
-in the meantime, check if anybody has tweeted at the bot with the right phrase
	-respond to them if so

markov.py contains all the nonsense for building the model
feed it a corpus of text and it'll analyze it to build a simple markov graph
before calling the generation function, kickstart its RNG with the current time or something, whatever

test.py authorizes with twitter, posts a test tweet, waits for you to check to see if it posted, and then deletes said tweet


Stuff I may want to implement later:
-lucky numbers
-let people tweet pictures of fortunes to the bot, then have it read them and add them to the corpus
